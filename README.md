# Streamlit Application for Interactive Maps and Data Analysis

This repository contains the code and data for a Streamlit application that visualizes interactive maps and data analysis related to animal populations and slaughterhouses. The project progresses through several steps: data cleaning, data merging, and the addition of interactive maps.

## Project Structure

- **Data Cleaning**: The initial phase involves cleaning the data, which is essential for accurate analysis.
- **Data Merging**: Cleaned data is then merged to prepare for interactive visualization.
- **Interactive Maps**: Maps showing slaughterhouse locations and animal population distributions are generated.

## Important Files

Below are the key files in this project:

- **Jupyter Notebooks**:
  - [Clean_Data.ipynb](./!Clean_Data.ipynb) - Notebook for cleaning the geographical data.
  - [Interactive_map.ipynb](./!interactive_map.ipynb) - Notebook for creating interactive maps with the bases of clean data.
  - [Slaughterhouse_html.ipynb](./!Slaughterhouse_html.ipynb) - Notebook for adding slaughterhouse location for various animals on html files.

- **Python Scripts**:
  - [Dashboard1.py](./!Dashboard1.py) - Python script for the main dashboard of the application.
